# ALCE-ASQA BENCHMARK

## 1. Description

`ALCE-ASQA` is different from the original `ASQA` dataset. The description of the original paper<sup>[1]</sup> on this dataset is as follows.
> ASQA<sup>[2]</sup> is a long-form factoid dataset. Each question is an ambiguous question from AmbigQA<sup>[3]</sup> and requires multiple short answers to cover different interpretations of the question. For example, the question “When did the US break away from England?” should be answered with both July 2, 1776 (declaration of independence) and September 3, 1783 (Treaty of Paris). The ambiguity nature of the questions necessitates synthesizing information from multiple documents. Stelmakh et al. crowdsourced long-form answers for each question to cover all short, disambiguated answers while providing essential background information. Human-written answers for ASQA have an average length of 65 words. Since most of the questions can be answered by Wikipedia, we use the 2018-12-20 Wikipedia snapshot as D. Using a small corpus allows researchers to deploy and study different retrieval methods at low cost, especially dense retrieval<sup>[4][5]</sup>.
> 
> We randomly select 1,000 examples from the development set of each dataset for ALCE. Our benchmark primarily assesses the citation capabilities of existing LLMs and does not provide training data, as there are no available examples that provide supervision for citations in these datasets.

## 2. Dataset

The ALCE-ASQA dataset consists of three versions: `GTR`, `DPR` and `Oracle`. Each versions contain 948 data entries with consistent questions. In the `GTR` and `DPR` version, each entry provides the top-100 passages retrieved using dense retrievers from the Wikipedia corpus. The `Oracle` version approximates golden passages through passages reranking, resulting in higher-quality passages compared to the previous version. Each passage is segmented into chunks of 100 words.

Additionally, each data entry includes annotated versions of `Summary` and `Snippet` generated by ChatGPT.

## 3. Metrics

In the original paper, the authors evaluated four metrics on the ASQA dataset: MAUVE, EM recall, Citation Recall, and Citation Precision. 

1. MAUVE<sup>[6]</sup>: MAUVE measures the similarity between two text distributions. Specifically, we concatenate the question and the model output and compare it to the distribution of question-gold-answer concatenation. **We will add this metric in future work.**
2. [EM recall](../../rageval/metrics/_answer_exact_match.py): EM recall calculates the recall of correct short answers by checking whether the short answers (provided by the dataset) are exact substrings of the generation.
3. [Citation Recall](../../rageval/metrics/_answer_citation_recall.py): Citation Recall determines if the result from LLM is entirely supported by cited passages.
4. [Citation Precision](../../rageval/metrics/_answer_citation_precision.py): Citation Precision detects citations that are irrelevant to the claim, but it does not require citing a minimal set and it permits citing redundant passages entailing similar claims.

Additionally, metrics such as ROUGE were also included in the evaluation, but no performance comparisons were made.

## 4. Usage

### 4.1 Prepare

Download and unzip the dataset, and install the RagEval tool.
```bash
script_dir=$(cd $(dirname $0);pwd)
cache_dir=$(dirname $(dirname $(dirname $script_dir)))/.rageval
wget -cP $cache_dir/datasets https://huggingface.co/datasets/princeton-nlp/ALCE-data/resolve/main/ALCE-data.tar
tar -xvf $cache_dir/datasets/ALCE-data.tar -C $cache_dir/datasets
python3 setup.py install
```

### 4.2 Generate examples

Replace api_key to your OpenAI api key in `run.sh` then run it to generate `gpt-3.5-turbo` response. The command is as follows:
```bash
python3 $script_dir/generate.py\
  --cache_path $cache_dir\
  --model gpt-3.5-turbo\
  --api_key "YOUR_API_KEY"\
  --dataset gtr\
  --method vanilla\
  --ndoc 5\
  --shot 2
```

You can also use local models for generation.
```bash
python3 $script_dir/generate.py\
  --cache_path $cache_dir\
  --model Llama-2-7b-chat-hf\
  --dataset gtr\
  --method vanilla\
  --ndoc 5\
  --shot 2
```

Arguements:
- `--cache_path`: The script automatically calculates the `cache_path`, so users generally don't need to specify it. The default path is the `.rageval` directory.
- `--model`: The model's name, currently supports OpenAI's API as well as open-source models like LLAMA.
- `--api_key`: When using OpenAI's API, the `api_key` parameter is required, otherwise, please ignore this parameter.
- `--max_length`: The maximum token count supported by the model.
- `--temperature/top_p`: The inference hyperparameters for LLM.
- `--dataset`: Version of the dataset: `gtr`, `dpr` or `oracle`.
- `--method`: Supports three generation methods: `vanilla`, `summary`, and `snippet`. The difference lies in the processing of the input documents.
- `--ndoc`: The number of documents provided to LLM during the generation process.
- `--shot`: The number of examples provided to LLM during the generation process.

### 4.3 Evaluation

You can download pre-generated result file from HuggingFace for evaluation.

```bash
python3 $script_dir/asqa_benchmark.py\
  --cache_path $cache_dir\
  --remote_split Llama_2_7b_chat_hf_vanilla_shot2_ndoc5
```

You can also specify locally saved result file for evaluation.

```bash
python3 $script_dir/asqa_benchmark.py\
  --cache_path $cache_dir\
  --local_file "YOUR_LOCAL_FILE"
```

Arguements:
- `--cache_path`: The script automatically calculates the `cache_path`, so users generally don't need to specify it. The default path is the `.rageval` directory.
- `--remote_split`: Download pplit dataset from [our huggingface dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/golaxy/rag-bench) to evaluate.
- `--local_file`: Specify locally saved result file to evaluate.
